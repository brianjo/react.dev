Our The React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections: 

## React {/*react*/}
Programatic React features:  
* [Hooks](/reference/react) - Use different React features from your components.
* [Components](/reference/react) - Documents built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
* [APIs](/reference/react) - APIs that are useful for defining components. 
* [Directives](/reference/react) - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.

## React DOM {/*react-dom*/}
React-dom contains features that are only supported for web applications 
(which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:

* [Hooks](/reference/react) - Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
* [Components](/reference/react) - React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
* [APIs](/reference/react) - The `react-dom` package contains methods supported only in web applications.
* [Client APIs](/reference/react) - The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). 
* [Server APIs](/reference/react) - The `react-dom/server` APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.

## Legacy APIs {/*legacy-apis*/}
* [Legacy APIs](/reference/react) - Exported from the react package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.
